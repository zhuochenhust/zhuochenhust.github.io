Cache Aware Processing-in-Memory Architecture
March 2016 to Present Members:Zhuo Chen
Our team proposes a new PIM architecture to decides whether to execute PIM operations in memory or processor depending on the locality of data. We present a tool, which analyzes the locality of the memory accesses for the different routines in an application.
Implemented pintools to identify regions of operations in the code that can be offload to PIM, figure out what fraction gets reused in the program after the PIM operation completes.
Local Music Player
June 2015 to Present Members:Zhuo Chen
Developed a local music player app based on Android four core components, in order to achieve media player by MediaPlayer object. This media player can get the music information from the system media library; the music can be paused, stopped and users can also play the next song.
1. The system activates asynchronous task by service, and using ContentProvider to access local media library in working thread and return the data by CallBack.
2. Users can stop, pause the music and users can also play next song. I achieved these functions by service. 3. The system can send notification by Notification-Skill, and users can stop, play, pause songs in the
notification bar.
4. The system can monitor the SD card and send broadcast during music playing to update seek bar.
